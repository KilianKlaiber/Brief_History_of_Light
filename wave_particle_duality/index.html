            But how can the evidence for the wave-nature of light be explained,
            if light is indeed made out of a collection of small particles
            called photons? The measured interference patterns agree almost
            perfectly with the theoretical predictions for electro-magnetic
            waves. The diffraction patterns for monochromatic light sent through
            single and double slit apertures are displayed above.
          </p>

          <p>
            The confusion about the nature of light was indeed amplified, when
            Davisson and Germer proved experminentally in 1927 that electrons
            also displayed interference patterns. Everything seemed to be both
            wave and particle simultaneously. Suddenly philosphical disputes
            arose among the community of scientists about the properties of
            nature. Does nature violate the rules of logic? Niels Bohr tried to
            solve the problem by stating that particle and wave properties are
            "complementary", i.e. these properties never occur at the same time
            but belong to the same object. This explanation always felt to me
            like a word game and not a solution.
          </p>

          <p>
            The solution in my mind was essentially found in 1926 by Max Born.
            He posited that the square of the interfering waves, i.e. their
            intensity, essentially represents a probability distribution for a
            photon to arrive at certain place. The interference pattern arises
            because a multitude of essentially identical photons randomly occur
            in agreement with the probability distribution.
          </p>

          <h3>The Probability Wave</h3>

          <p>
            Born's interpretation was confirmed, when single photons and
            electrons could be sent consecutively through a double-slit
            aperture. This is illustrated above for electrons. A single
            particle, photon or electron, does not create the diffraction
            pattern. The diffraction pattern is the result of a multitude of
            essentially identical particles randomly occuring on the screen
            behind the aperture. The screen is bright, where many particles
            arrive, and black, where none arrive. The level of brightness is
            measure for the probability of the particle to arrive at this place.
          </p>

            However, the solution has a severe drawback. Natural phenomena are
            no longer thought of as the predetermined effect of a cause.
            Instead, physics must describe nature as governed by chance.
            Naturally, many scientists rejected this conclusion. Einstein was
            opposed to this new theory although he had contributed to its
            emergence. He famously rebuked to Born:
