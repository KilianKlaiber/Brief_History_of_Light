          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            We have all witnessed the reflection of light in nature. On a bright
            summer's day the calm and smooth surface of a pure mountain lake may
            reflect light like a perfect mirror. But why do we see an images in
            a lake, where there is no object?
          </p>

          <img
            src="./img/AngleOfReflextion.jpg"
            alt="Angle of Reflection"
            title="Angle of Reflection"
          >

          <p>
            The angle of incidence of light is equal to the angle of
            reflection.. The reflected light reaches the observer at the angle
            of reflection. The source of light apppears as virtual object the
            observer.
          </p>

            Notice that a pool ball is reflected from the boundary of the table
            in just the same manner as light is reflected from a mirror.
            Therefore, scientists like Newton believed that light is essentially
            a stream of tiny balls called particles.
          </p>

            However, light is not merely reflected from surfaces like billiard
            balls. Light appears to bend into a different direction, when it
            passes from air into a different medium like glass or water. The
            relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of
            refraction is known as Snell's law.

            In his 1678 Traité de la Lumière, Christiaan Huygens showed how
            Snell's law could be explained by the wave nature of light, using
            what we have come to call the Huygens principle. This was the first
            strong evidence that light is not a particle but a wave.
