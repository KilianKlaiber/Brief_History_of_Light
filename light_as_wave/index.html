          <h2>Waves</h2>
          <p>
            At first glance there appears to be no connection between light and
            waves. The waves of the ocean look and behave very different from
            light. In order to see the similarities, one must look at the
            properties that all waves have in common.
          </p>
          <h3>Interference</h3>
          <img
            src="./img/Interference.jpg"
            alt="Interference patterns for circular waves"
          >
          <p>
            Interference is the property that distinguishes waves from
            particles. If two distinct waves meet, the waves pass through each
            other without being disturbed. During the meeting distinct patterns
            emerge called interference pattersn.
          </p>

          <img
            src="./img/Waventerference.gif"
            alt="Interferece of two monochromatic waves"
          >
          <p>
            The above image shows a red and a blue wave that meet. The resulting
            wave is shown in red. The resulting wave appears to appear and
            disappear without moving in any direction. This is called a standing
            wave. If you look closely, then you will recognize that at certain
            points the resulting red wave does not change with time; it has
            neither crest nor trough at these points.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the two wave crests meet each other, then the resultant wave
            crest will be greater than the individual displacement of each
            crest. This type of interference is known as Constructive
            interference. If a wave crest meets a wave trough the resulting wave
            disappears. This type is called destructive interference.
          </p>
          <h3>Diffraction</h3>
          <img
            src="./img/Laser_Interference.jpeg"
            alt="Diffraction patter of a laser"
          >
          <p>
            The above image displays a diffraction pattern of a red laser beam
            projected onto a plate after passing through a small circular
            aperture in another plate. These diffraction patterns result from
            interference.Wherever the pattern is dark, destructive interference
            has cancelled the wave; wherever the pattern is very bright, this is
            the result of constructive interference.

            The <b>color</b> of light is indicative of its wavelength. The
            <b>brightness</b> of light or its intensity is proportional to the
            square of the size of its crest and trough; the square of the
            amplitude is proportional to the intensity. Finally, we need to
            understand what is actually oscillating in a light wave.

          <h3>Electro-Magnetic Wave</h3>

            Unlike the surface wave on a lake light is not a disturbance in a
            medium like water. This idea was controversial; the prevailing
            opinion among scientists was for a long time that the carrier medium
            of light waves, dubbed ether, must exist. Physicists searched for
            this medium for centuries until the Michelsonâ€“Morley experiment
            proved that this medium does not exist. Instead, light waves
            represent electric fields, <em>E</em>, and magnetic fields,
            <em>B</em>, that propagate through vacuum at the speed <em>v</em> in
            a direction perpendicular to both E and B.

          <h3>Photoelectric Effect</h3>
          <img
            src="./img/Photoelectric_effect_in_a_solid_-_diagram.svg"
            alt="Photo-Electric Effect"
          >
          <p>
            At the end of the 19th century physicists were convinced that they
            had understood the nature of light. However there was one lurking
            problem. The interaction of light with electrons in a solid. It was
            shown that electrons could be emitted from the surface of a
            conductor by radiating light onto it. Physicist learned how to
            measure the energy and speed of the emitted electrons by careful
            design of their experiments.
          </p>

          <p>
            What was the problem? If light were a wave, then the square of the amplitude or
            size of the wave should be indicative of its energy. This energy is
            transferred to the electrons. Thus, the energy of the emitted
            electrons should increase if the brightness or intensity of the wave
            is increased.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, this is not what happens. The energy of the emitted
            electrons is independent of the amplitude of the light wave; the
            electron's energy depends merely on the wavelength of light. The
            wavelength is the distance between the neighbouring crests of a
            wave. Increasing the intensity of the imitted light merely increases
            the number of emitted electrons.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1905 Einstein proposed a theory for the photoelectric effact.
            According to Einstein, light consists of tiny particles, called
            photons. These photons transfer their energy to the electrons. This
            is the prevailing interpretation of the photoelectric effect.
